        </h4>
        <p className="pl-5 pr-10 pb-5">
          Our story begins not in a colorful town in northern Italy, but in a
          drab one in southeastern Wisconsin. In a community that had once all
          but passed a law banning the mowing of lawns on Sundays, I used to
          hide in my bed with a weathered MacBook and watch all the gay movies I
          could find for free on the internet. Each had its own cinematic
          nuance, but a common thread united them nonetheless: from{" "}
          <em>Speedway Junky to Head On</em>, all ended with the failure,
          collapse, and lonely heartbreak of any queer relationship depicted.
          Whether friendly or romantic, the relationships I saw taught me that I
          would never be happy, I would never have a healthy social life, and I
          would always be alone, distracting myself from this misery by pursuing
          increasingly promiscuous interactions. And herein lies the first
          problem with <em>Call Me by Your Name</em>.
        </p>
        <p className="pl-5 pr-10 pb-5">
          Although the setting and cinematography are more gorgeous than its
          genetic predecessors, <em>Call Me by Your Name</em> is still just the
          same hetero-cinematographic viewpoint on homosexual and queer
          relationships with a facelift. Sure, the movie-going public has become
          far more comfortable with the idea of two men kissing on screen than
          they were in, say, 2006 when <em>Brokeback Mountain</em> appeared in
          movie theaters, but not comfortable enough not to pan away from
          anything <em>beyond</em> a kiss shared between men, which happens in{" "}
          <em>Call Me by Your Name</em>. When Elio and Oliver go to bed together
          for the first time, the camera swings toward a tree just outside the
          window. However, we see a bird’s-eye view of the conjugal heterosexual
          relationship between Elio and Marzia, seventeen-year-olds having what
          could otherwise be called a cliché, teen-movie, summer-fling, sexual
          awakening. No matter how you interpret the filmic merits of an
          arborescent effacement of homosexual intimacy, there is a clear gap
          between how heterosexual and homosexual relationships are depicted
          early on.
        </p>

        <p className="pl-5 pr-10 pb-5">
          But the lack of gay sex in a movie meant to be about a gay
          relationship is not the biggest problem with{" "}
          <em>Call Me by Your Name</em>; anyone interested in seeing gay sex in
          its entirety can find it elsewhere, and likely for free, on the
          internet. Still, Luca Guadagnino has an argument for his exclusion of
          the coital scene between Elio and Oliver: “I refuse with strong
          firmness that I was coy in not showing [their sex scene], because I
          think that Oliver and Elio…displayed a very strong intimacy and
          closeness in so many ways and it was enough (Guadagnino, quoted by
          Dry). It is disheartening that Guadagnino speaks about gay sex as
          though it were somehow outside of the closeness and intimacy he
          describes. In fact, the fulfilment of desire through sex deserves
          better than to be portrayed as a mere physical act that debases the
          emotional connection between Elio and Oliver. Attempting to “purify”
          the queer relationship by effacing its physical element is othering in
          a subtly harmful way. Elio and Marzia also share an intimacy and
          closeness that is still allowed its physical aspect, implying
          heterosexual relationships are inherently pure.
        </p>

        <p className="pl-5 pr-10 pb-5">
          Though by itself the lack of a visually explicit sex scene is
          immaterial in the film’s merit as queer art, juxtaposed with an
          in-your-face heterosexuality the difference becomes the problematic
          element. What isn’t there becomes the focus, and ultimately, the
          viewer is distracted by the implicit—that a gay relationship should be
          secret, invisible, unspoken—and pushed out of the film’s built world.
          What we end up with is a theater of the impossible centered on a
          foregone conclusion, and a broken one at that. What we lose is a
          valuable meditation on desire as it is eclipsed by the specter of
          cliché.
        </p>

        <p className="pl-5 pr-10 pb-5">
          And that is the tragedy of <em>Call Me by Your Name’s</em> failure as
          queer art despite depicting a gay relationship. It espouses the same
          view of queer relationships as inevitably flawed in light of the
          ideal, heterosexual relationships flourishing around them—a
          fundamentally clichéd perspective. Clichés teach us nothing new about
          how to look at the world, which is exactly what, if you see no other
          value in us, we marginalized peoples can bring to art: new
          perspectives.
        </p>

        <p className="pl-5 pr-10 pb-5">
          I understand that straight artists have often misunderstood and
          misrepresented us as being sex obsessed—single faceted characters
          interested only in the physical—but that is precisely why Guadagnino
          should have included the sex scene. By his own logic, the sex would
          have been intimate and close, a perspective on gay sex unfamiliar to
          straight audiences. While <em>Head On’s</em> ending of a queer man
          deciding quite explicitly to live for casual sex alone is an imperfect
          and problematic one, so too is <em>Speedway Junky’s</em>, which
          despite focusing on a queer friendship, still ends in a dramatization
          of unattainability that cinema at this point had decided was inherent
          to queer lives. As such, when <em>Call Me by Your Name</em> ends with
          Elio crying alone after learning Oliver will marry a woman, viewers
          are shown the same cliché that was already tired by the release of{" "}
          <em>Speedway Junky</em>. Here too, queer relationships are different
          because they are unsustainable, unhealthy, and self-destructive.
        </p>

        <p className="pl-5 pr-10 pb-5">
          But that is not our story, and if we want a truly queer cinema, we
          must demand better. We must demand nuanced queer stories where when
          societal pressures play a strong role, as in our lives, they do not
          determine the possibility of queer relationships. Queer desire should
          be put carefully and lovingly on display, probed and interrogated
          until it gives us something beautiful and new.
          <em>In Call Me by Your</em>
          Name, desire again tried to show us what it could teach, but its
          message got lost in the comfortable rhythm of telling an old story the
          same way.

          The Variable of Absence: Caitlin Bailey’s <em>Solve</em> for Desire
        </h1>

        <h4 className="py-5 pl-5 pr-16 text-sm">
          (Originally published in Issue 65 of <em>Great River Review</em> pages
          133-135)
        </h4>

        <p className="pl-5 pr-10 pb-5">
          In the very first poem of her debut collection
          <em>Solve for Desire</em>, Caitlin Bailey begins to carve out the
          “hollow” where “only the sweetest grass” grows. “Whoever Drinks from
          Me” immediately presents “Brother as thirst,” a connection suggesting
          not only an absence of the brother, who may be understood as Georg
          Trakl, the great Modernist poet, but also a painful absence. Yet, the
          speaker of the poem, possibly the poet’s sister, Grete Trakl, goes on
          to describe “Water [as] meant to wound,” compli- cating the pain of
          the brother’s absence, making the case that relief from thirst would
          be no relief at all, just a different kind of pain, a wound.
        </p>

        <p className="pl-5 pr-10 pb-5">
          But what of the sweetness of the grass? Perhaps that image of growth,
          and its qualification—surrounded by pain—nods to the complicated re-
          lationship between the poet Georg Trakl and his sister Grete Trakl,
          the excavation of whom was Bailey’s inciting task. In the process of
          tracing Grete’s life, peppered with her skill at the piano and
          addiction to drugs, Bailey’s imagination comes to life. Through her
          careful study of Georg’s poetry and the letters shared by the
          siblings, Grete’s voice and others Bailey uncovered along the way ring
          through with a clarity all the more haunting for their having burst
          into an empty room. The project of <em>Solve for Desire</em> takes on
          another task, then: filling the longstanding absence of those voices
          and laying bare that which refuses to go unnoticed.
        </p>

        <p className="pl-5 pr-10 pb-5">
          And it is from this framework of pain without relief, of shifting and
          variable absence that “Whoever Drinks from Me” establishes that we
          begin to understand the reason Grete tells Georg “I will never, never
          leave you.” In fact, the replacement of desire and grief by other
          desire and other grief is a thread woven throughout{" "}
          <em>Solve for Desire</em>. “Grete Writes to Georg at War” puts it best
          when Grete says “G, you might have been the prize. / The salt packed
          in my organs, / the magnificent shore.” Here, she imagines having the
          object of her desire, replacing the variable of absence with the
          specification of presence, but that which should fill a gap—the salt
          between the organs, the shore between the 134 Great River Review land
          and sea—actually becomes the gap, embodying the space between the
          organs, between the land the sea.
        </p>

        <p className="pl-5 pr-10 pb-5">
          Again, in “Some Elaborate” Grete laments, “You leave me every day in
          small ways, / and I imagine your organs must be eroding, / your skin
          the only shoreline I want to visit.” Her desire becomes wrapped up in
          this replacement of the gap, this undefinable variable of absence,
          making her desire at once more tragic and nuanced. It is not Georg’s
          skin she wants to visit but the space of absence; Grete wants to
          embody for herself the condition that seems to predicate her desire
          for Georg:
        </p>

        <p className="px-14 pb-5">
          I am hostage to your absence, <br />
          filling a bucket, even the most familiar
          <br />
          street a wilderness I don’t recognize, <br />a waterline I keep
          expecting will change
        </p>

        <p className="pl-5 pr-10 pb-5">
          This final stanza ends without punctuation in hopes that the change is
          yet to come, but as before, the change is simply a shift from one
          absence to another, a change that changes nothing, and the lack of a
          period, too, does not make this fact any less final or inescapable.
        </p>

        <p className="pl-5 pr-10 pb-5">
          Just before section three, however, there is a shift from desire to
          grief, and it is there, in “Somewhere a Key,” that the permeability of
          the two emotions, their interconnectedness, becomes clearer:
        </p>

        <p className="px-14 pb-5">
          You are a sickness still lingering, rotten pit to be rent from the
          chest, sour blood to drain. Crows repeatedly fly into the windows.
          Done numbing myself, or else the money’s run out. You must know I keep
          writing these letters, missives dropped around the city, crumbs for
          your ghost. Almost all the rooms inside me are closed. Each time I
          write your name a key somewhere turns in a lock.
        </p>

        <p className="pl-5 pr-10 pb-5">
          Desire lingers, but it has rotted, fermented into grief, for now that
          the money’s run out—now that the very sign of variable absence is used
          up—and now that Georg is a ghost, desire is pure absence, an unful-
          fillable lack looping back on itself. Crows throw themselves against
          the invisible barriers separating inside from outside, revealing them
          “the way glass catches the light” (“On Never Marrying Him”), likewise
          revealing absence itself as a kind of presence. Desire and grief are
          the refraction of absence, which is at once light and glass—the
          presence of absence revealed by absence of the desired.
        </p>

        <p className="pl-5 pr-10 pb-5">
          In fact, in “Grete Asks the Hard Question,” in section three, Grete’s
          desire to experience the space of absence, to embody the cause of her
          desire in grief—to take them for herself and become the determiner of
          her own emotion—becomes clear when she says “I tell you my body is a
          hollow, a fence, how there are so many / colors I’ll never see. Let me
          be refracted as you see best.” And this is Bailey’s triumph in{" "}
          <em>Solve for Desire</em>: not only does she unite desire and grief in
          an indeterminate space all too familiar to those who have lived it but
          she lays bare the desire within that space to master it, to overcome
          and own the monstrous desire-grief hybrid created by the death of a
          loved one. But, perhaps devastatingly so, the unattainability of this
          desire emerges too; just as Grete’s desire to replace the absences—the
          gaps—simply produces new absences, when thinking of deceased loved
          ones, when “Sometimes [they] visit [us] / [their] hands become birds,
          unfurl the whole forest.” Grief opens up, ex- pands and explains the
          forest, but in so doing moves further out of reach.
        </p>

        <p className="pl-5 pr-10 pb-5">
          In <em>Solve for Desire</em>, Caitlin Bailey offers the gift of a voice
          excavated from the history of her brother’s fame and tragedy. A task
          admirable in and of itself, Bailey empowers this voice so thoroughly
          that it begins to call for emancipation from its own grief and desire.
          Grete speaks so clear- ly through <em>Solve for Desire</em> that she begins to
          excavate herself, brushing off what debris is left behind by the work
          Bailey has already done to free her. What’s more is the way this
          excavation, this self-emancipation, is interwoven with that very same
          grief and desire that seem to conceal the voice at times. Through
          intricate turns and returns to the examination of separation and
          absence, Bailey and Grete work together to reveal grief and desire in
          all their complexity at the same time as they complicate prevailing
          notions of what grief and desire can do. <em>Solve for Desire</em> makes the
          productive potential of wrestling with complex, and at times insur-
          mountable or ungraspable emotions, clear; the struggle to understand,
          embody, and overcome this desire-grief is the condition of possibility
          for freedom from the very same. Grief and desire become the tools
          through which we work toward control, through which we see the “light
          stream- ing through glass, / streaked onto palms.” By exposing
          absence’s tenu- ous hold on desire and grief, Bailey shows us that the
          tools are, in fact, in our hands.
